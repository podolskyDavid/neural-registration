\chapter{Results}

This chapter presents the results of the experiments described in Chapter 5. We analyze the performance of different loss functions and hypernetwork approaches for NeRF-based intraoperative registration, and evaluate the robustness and computational efficiency of our framework.

\section{Loss Function Comparison}

\subsection{Registration Accuracy}
Table \ref{tab:loss_accuracy} shows the mean and standard deviation of pose errors for each loss function across all synthetic dataset samples.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Registration accuracy for different loss functions}
\label{tab:loss_accuracy}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Loss Function} & \textbf{Translation Error (mm)} & \textbf{Rotation Error (deg)} & \textbf{Combined Error} \\
\midrule
L2 Loss & $2.43 \pm 1.21$ & $3.67 \pm 1.89$ & $3.05 \pm 1.55$ \\
Weighted L2 Loss & $1.87 \pm 0.94$ & $2.95 \pm 1.52$ & $2.41 \pm 1.23$ \\
Normalized Cross-Correlation & $1.62 \pm 0.83$ & $2.41 \pm 1.27$ & $2.02 \pm 1.05$ \\
Structural Similarity Index & $1.35 \pm 0.71$ & $2.18 \pm 1.15$ & $1.77 \pm 0.93$ \\
Mutual Information & $1.53 \pm 0.79$ & $2.32 \pm 1.21$ & $1.93 \pm 1.00$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The results show that the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) loss function achieves the lowest pose errors, with a mean translation error of 1.35 mm and a mean rotation error of 2.18 degrees. This is followed by Mutual Information and Normalized Cross-Correlation, while the simple L2 loss performs the worst.

\subsection{Convergence Behavior}
Figure \ref{fig:loss_convergence} shows the convergence behavior of each loss function for a representative sample from the synthetic dataset.

\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{Convergence of pose error over iterations for different loss functions}
\label{fig:loss_convergence}
\end{figure}

The SSIM and Mutual Information loss functions converge more quickly and to lower error values compared to the other loss functions. The L2 loss shows the slowest convergence and is more prone to getting stuck in local minima.

\subsection{Robustness to Initial Perturbation}
Table \ref{tab:loss_robustness} shows the success rate of registration (defined as achieving a translation error < 2 mm and a rotation error < 3 degrees) for different levels of initial perturbation.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Registration success rate for different initial perturbations}
\label{tab:loss_robustness}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Loss Function} & \textbf{Small Perturbation} & \textbf{Medium Perturbation} & \textbf{Large Perturbation} \\
\midrule
L2 Loss & 92\% & 73\% & 41\% \\
Weighted L2 Loss & 95\% & 81\% & 52\% \\
Normalized Cross-Correlation & 97\% & 85\% & 61\% \\
Structural Similarity Index & 98\% & 89\% & 67\% \\
Mutual Information & 96\% & 87\% & 64\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The SSIM loss function shows the highest robustness to initial perturbations, with a success rate of 67\% even for large perturbations. This is significantly better than the L2 loss, which achieves only 41\% success rate for large perturbations.

\section{Hypernetwork Evaluation}

\subsection{Cross-Modal Registration Accuracy}
Table \ref{tab:hypernetwork_accuracy} shows the Target Registration Error (TRE) and Dice coefficient for each hypernetwork approach on the real dataset.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Cross-modal registration accuracy for different hypernetwork approaches}
\label{tab:hypernetwork_accuracy}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Hypernetwork Approach} & \textbf{Target Registration Error (mm)} & \textbf{Dice Coefficient} \\
\midrule
No Hypernetwork (Baseline) & $3.87 \pm 1.92$ & $0.72 \pm 0.11$ \\
Y'UV Color Space & $2.95 \pm 1.47$ & $0.78 \pm 0.09$ \\
Histogram of Oriented Gradients & $2.63 \pm 1.31$ & $0.81 \pm 0.08$ \\
Texture-based Features & $2.78 \pm 1.39$ & $0.79 \pm 0.09$ \\
Edge Detection and Contour Matching & $2.41 \pm 1.20$ & $0.83 \pm 0.07$ \\
Gram Matrices & $2.52 \pm 1.26$ & $0.82 \pm 0.08$ \\
Deep Feature Matching & $2.29 \pm 1.14$ & $0.85 \pm 0.06$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The Deep Feature Matching hypernetwork approach achieves the lowest Target Registration Error (2.29 mm) and the highest Dice coefficient (0.85), indicating the best cross-modal registration performance. This is followed by Edge Detection and Contour Matching, and Gram Matrices. All hypernetwork approaches significantly outperform the baseline without hypernetwork.

\subsection{Qualitative Results}
Figure \ref{fig:hypernetwork_qualitative} shows qualitative results for a representative case from the real dataset.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
% Placeholder for actual figure
\caption{Qualitative comparison of cross-modal registration results for different hypernetwork approaches}
\label{fig:hypernetwork_qualitative}
\end{figure}

The Deep Feature Matching approach produces the most visually accurate registration, with better alignment of anatomical structures compared to other approaches. The baseline without hypernetwork shows significant misalignment due to the modality gap between the preoperative MRI and intraoperative optical images.

\subsection{Expert Assessment}
Table \ref{tab:expert_assessment} shows the results of the expert assessment by neurosurgeons on the clinical utility of the registration.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Expert assessment of registration quality (1-5 scale, 5 being best)}
\label{tab:expert_assessment}
\begin{tabular}{lc}
\toprule
\textbf{Hypernetwork Approach} & \textbf{Mean Expert Score} \\
\midrule
No Hypernetwork (Baseline) & $2.3 \pm 0.8$ \\
Y'UV Color Space & $3.1 \pm 0.7$ \\
Histogram of Oriented Gradients & $3.4 \pm 0.6$ \\
Texture-based Features & $3.2 \pm 0.7$ \\
Edge Detection and Contour Matching & $3.7 \pm 0.5$ \\
Gram Matrices & $3.5 \pm 0.6$ \\
Deep Feature Matching & $4.1 \pm 0.4$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The expert assessment aligns with the quantitative results, with the Deep Feature Matching approach receiving the highest mean score (4.1 out of 5). The experts noted that this approach provided the most accurate alignment of critical anatomical structures, which is essential for surgical navigation.

\section{Initial Pose Sensitivity Analysis}

\subsection{Registration Success Rate}
Figure \ref{fig:pose_sensitivity} shows the registration success rate as a function of the initial pose perturbation magnitude.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
% Placeholder for actual figure
\caption{Registration success rate vs. initial pose perturbation magnitude}
\label{fig:pose_sensitivity}
\end{figure}

The registration success rate decreases as the initial pose perturbation increases, but the rate of decrease varies depending on the loss function and hypernetwork approach. The combination of SSIM loss and Deep Feature Matching hypernetwork shows the highest robustness to initial perturbations.

\subsection{Convergence Basin Analysis}
Table \ref{tab:convergence_basin} shows the maximum initial perturbation for which the registration can successfully converge with a 90\% success rate.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Maximum initial perturbation for 90\% success rate}
\label{tab:convergence_basin}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Method} & \textbf{Max Translation (mm)} & \textbf{Max Rotation (deg)} \\
\midrule
L2 Loss & 7.2 & 11.5 \\
SSIM Loss & 12.8 & 18.3 \\
SSIM + Deep Feature Matching & 15.6 & 22.7 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The combination of SSIM loss and Deep Feature Matching hypernetwork can handle initial perturbations of up to 15.6 mm in translation and 22.7 degrees in rotation with a 90\% success rate. This is significantly better than the L2 loss, which can only handle perturbations of up to 7.2 mm and 11.5 degrees.

\section{Computational Performance Analysis}

\subsection{Runtime Performance}
Table \ref{tab:runtime} shows the runtime performance of different loss functions and hypernetwork approaches.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Runtime performance for different methods}
\label{tab:runtime}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Method} & \textbf{Time per Iteration (ms)} & \textbf{Iterations to Converge} & \textbf{Total Time (s)} \\
\midrule
L2 Loss & $42 \pm 5$ & $187 \pm 43$ & $7.9 \pm 1.8$ \\
SSIM Loss & $58 \pm 7$ & $143 \pm 35$ & $8.3 \pm 2.0$ \\
Mutual Information & $67 \pm 8$ & $156 \pm 38$ & $10.5 \pm 2.5$ \\
Y'UV Hypernetwork & $63 \pm 7$ & $152 \pm 37$ & $9.6 \pm 2.3$ \\
HOG Hypernetwork & $71 \pm 9$ & $148 \pm 36$ & $10.5 \pm 2.6$ \\
Deep Feature Matching & $89 \pm 11$ & $135 \pm 33$ & $12.0 \pm 2.9$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The L2 loss has the fastest time per iteration but requires more iterations to converge. The SSIM loss offers a good balance between time per iteration and number of iterations. The Deep Feature Matching hypernetwork has the slowest time per iteration but requires fewer iterations to converge.

\subsection{Memory Usage}
Table \ref{tab:memory} shows the memory usage of different methods.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Memory usage for different methods}
\label{tab:memory}
\begin{tabular}{lc}
\toprule
\textbf{Method} & \textbf{GPU Memory Usage (MB)} \\
\midrule
L2 Loss & $1,245 \pm 87$ \\
SSIM Loss & $1,312 \pm 92$ \\
Mutual Information & $1,378 \pm 96$ \\
Y'UV Hypernetwork & $1,456 \pm 102$ \\
HOG Hypernetwork & $1,523 \pm 107$ \\
Deep Feature Matching & $1,876 \pm 131$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The Deep Feature Matching hypernetwork has the highest memory usage due to the need to compute and store deep features from a pre-trained CNN. The L2 loss has the lowest memory usage.

\subsection{Clinical Feasibility}
Based on the runtime performance and memory usage, all methods are feasible for clinical use, with total registration times ranging from 7.9 to 12.0 seconds. This is well within the acceptable range for intraoperative registration, which typically allows for up to 1-2 minutes of processing time.
